# Text Generation using Bidirectional LSTM

This project demonstrates text generation using a Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

Text generation is the task of generating new text based on input data. In this project, we utilize a Bidirectional LSTM model, which is capable of capturing both past and future context, to generate text character by character.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your system along with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-bidirectional-lstm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd text-generation-bidirectional-lstm
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python text_generation_bidirectional_lstm.py
   ```

4. The script will train the Bidirectional LSTM model using the provided sample text and generate new text based on a seed text input.
